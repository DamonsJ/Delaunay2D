# Delaunay2D
Delaunay triangulation in 2d plane, which is present by half-edge structure

This program is refered with https://github.com/eloraiby/delaunay
I just re-implement using half-edge data-structure

This code is very very ugly, but ,for me,more easy understand than https://github.com/eloraiby/delaunay
